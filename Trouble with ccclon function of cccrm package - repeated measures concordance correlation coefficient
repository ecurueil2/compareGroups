I am R beginner and have a question concerning programming with "R" - ccclon-function from cccrm-package (Concordance Correlation Coefficient for Repeated measures).

I have data from a child study cohort. Some children took part more than one time (only in different years - at different ages). Children always have the same "ID" (see below rind) but "visitnumber" ranges from 1 to 4 (see rtime). In that special case, I would like to compare (for all visits from all probands), the values of two different measuring methods (rmet=method, ry=methodresult) for the same blood parameter. Because I would like to include all follow-up-visits of children (repeat), I chose cccrm-package (repeated measures concordance correlation coefficient).

a<-ccclon(child,
           ry="methodresult",
           rind= "ID",
           rtime="visitnumber",
           rmet="method",
           covar=NULL, 
           rho=0,
           cl=0.95)
           
Thereafter, I recieve the warning: "error in ccclon(child, ry = "methodresult", rind = "ID", rtime = "visitnumber", : Non-positive definite approximate variance-covariance"
What could I change here?

If I add fixed effects for covar, warnings remain :

... covar="sex",...
same warning as above

...covar="age",...
warning: "error in C[, k] <- c(1, contrasts(dades$met)[i, ], contrasts(dades$time)[j, : number of elements to be replaced is not a multiple of replacement length"

...covar="age", "sex",...
warning: "unused argument ("sex")"

Thank you in advance for any advice!
